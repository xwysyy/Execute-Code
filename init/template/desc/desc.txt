# Problem Statement

Given \(N\), \(V\), an array \(v\) of length \(N\) representing the volume of items, and an array \(w\) of length \(N\) representing the value of items:  
There are \(N\) items and a backpack with a capacity of \(V\). Each item can only be used once.  
The \(i\)-th item has a volume of \(v[i]\) and a value of \(w[i]\).  

Determine which items to put in the backpack such that the **total volume does not exceed the backpack's capacity** and the **total value is maximized**. Return the maximum total value.

The solution's main function is:  
`int solve(int &N, int &V, vector<int> &v, vector<int> &w)`  
where:  
- `N` is the number of items,  
- `V` is the capacity of the backpack,  
- `v` is the array of item volumes,  
- `w` is the array of item values.  

# Example 1  
Input:  
```
N = 3  
V = 4  
v = [4, 3, 1]  
w = [1, 2, 1]  
```  
Output:  
```
2
```

Explanation:  
The maximum value of items that can be put in the backpack is 2. One optimal selection is:  
- Take the item with volume \(v[2] = 3\) and value \(w[2] = 2\).  

# Constraints:  
- \(0 < N, V, v[i], w[i] \leq @data\)  
- Time limit: @time_limit ms  
- Memory limit: @memory_limit KB
