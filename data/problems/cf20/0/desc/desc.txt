# Problem Statement
Mushroom Filippov cooked himself a meal and while having his lunch, he decided to watch a video on TubeTube. He can not spend more than $t$ seconds for lunch, so he asks you for help with the selection of video.

The TubeTube feed is a list of $n$ videos, indexed from $1$ to $n$. The $i$\-th video lasts $a_i$ seconds and has an entertainment value $b_i$. Initially, the feed is opened on the first video, and Mushroom can skip to the next video in $1$ second (if the next video exists). Mushroom can skip videos any number of times (including zero).

Help Mushroom choose **one** video that he can open and watch in $t$ seconds. If there are several of them, he wants to choose the most entertaining one. Print the index of any appropriate video, or $-1$ if there is no such.

The main function of the solution is defined as:  
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int solve(int &n, int &t, vector<int> &a, vector<int> &b) {   
        // write your code here
    }
};
```
where:  
- `n` is the number of videos
- `t` is the lunch time
- `a` is the duration of the videos
- `b` is the entertainment value of the videos

# Example 1:  
- Input:  
n = 5 
t = 9
a = [1, 5, 7, 6, 6]
b = [3, 4, 7, 1, 9]
- Output:  
3

# Constraints:  
- $1 \leq n \leq 100000$  
- $1 \leq a[i], b[i], t \leq 10^9$
- Time limit: 1000 ms  
- Memory limit: 6400 KB
