### Explanation:
1. **DP Array Initialization**: We initialize a DP array `dp` of size `V + 1` with all elements set to 0. `dp[j]` will store the maximum value that can be achieved with a backpack capacity of `j`.

2. **Iterating Over Items**: We iterate over each item in the list. For each item, we consider whether to include it in the backpack or not.

3. **Updating the DP Array**: For each capacity `j` from `V` down to `v[i]`, we update `dp[j]` to be the maximum of its current value and the value we get by including the current item (`dp[j - v[i]] + w[i]`). This ensures that we only consider including the item if it fits within the remaining capacity.

4. **Result**: After processing all items, `dp[V]` will contain the maximum value that can be achieved with the backpack capacity `V`.

### Example Walkthrough:
For the input `N = 3, V = 4, v = [4, 3, 1], w = [1, 2, 1]`:
- Initialize `dp = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
- Process the first item (volume 4, value 1):
  - Update `dp[4] = max(0, dp[0] + 1) = 1`.
- Process the second item (volume 3, value 2):
  - Update `dp[3] = max(0, dp[0] + 2) = 2`.
  - Update `dp[4] = max(1, dp[1] + 2) = 2`.
- Process the third item (volume 1, value 1):
  - Update `dp[1] = max(0, dp[0] + 1) = 1`.
  - Update `dp[2] = max(0, dp[1] + 1) = 2`.
  - Update `dp[3] = max(2, dp[2] + 1) = 2`.
  - Update `dp[4] = max(2, dp[3] + 1) = 3`.

The final `dp` array is `[0, 1, 2, 2, 3]`, and the maximum value is `dp[4] = 3`.

However, in the example provided, the expected output is `2`, which suggests that the problem might have additional constraints or a different interpretation. If the problem requires selecting exactly one item from each type, the solution would need to be adjusted accordingly.
