/*

Here is the C++ code to solve the 0/1 Knapsack problem:

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int N, V;
    cin >> N >> V;

    vector<int> v(N), w(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        cin >> v[i] >> w[i];
    }

    vector<int> dp(V + 1, 0);

    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        for (int j = V; j >= v[i]; --j) {
            dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - v[i]] + w[i]);

    }

    cout << dp[V] << endl;

}

### Explanation:
- **Input Reading**: The first line reads `N` (number of items) and `V` (backpack capacity). The next `N` lines read the volume `v[i]` and value `w[i]` of each item.
- **Dynamic Programming Array**: `dp[j]` represents the maximum value that can be achieved with a backpack capacity of `j`.
- **DP Update**: For each item, update the `dp` array in reverse order to ensure that each item is used only once.
- **Output**: The final result is `dp[V]`, which is the maximum value that can be achieved with the given backpack capacity.

This code efficiently solves the problem within the given constraints.
