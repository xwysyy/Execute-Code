# Problem Statement
There is a grid, consisting of $2$ rows and $n$ columns. The rows are numbered from $1$ to $2$ from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from $1$ to $n$ from left to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell $(1, 1)$. Every second, the following two actions happen one after another:

1.  Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (**it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move**);
2.  then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move).

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell $(2, n)$.

The main function of the solution is defined as:  
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string solve(int &n, string &s1, string &s2) {   
        // write your code here
    }
};
```
where:  
- `s1` is a string of length $n$, representing the directions of the arrows in the first row
- `s2` is a string of length $n$, representing the directions of the arrows in the second row
- return "YES" or "NO"

# Example 1:  
- Input:  
n = 4
s1 =">><<"
s2 =">>><"
- Output:  
YES

# Constraints:  
- $1 \leq n \leq 100000$
- n is even
- No arrow points outside the grid
- Time limit: 1000 ms  
- Memory limit: 6400 KB
