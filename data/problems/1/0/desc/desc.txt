There are **N** items and a **backpack with a capacity of V**. Each item can only be used once.  

The **volume** of the i-th item is `v[i]`, and its **value** is `w[i]`.  

The problem is to determine which items to put into the backpack so that the total volume of the selected items does not exceed the backpack's capacity, and their total value is maximized.  

Output the **maximum value** that can be achieved.  

**Constraints:**
- \( 0 < N, V, v[i], w[i] \leq \text{10} \)

**Time limit**: \(\text{1000} ms\)  
**Memory limit**: \(\text{6400} KB\)
