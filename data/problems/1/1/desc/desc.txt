Given N, V, an array v of length N, and an array w of length N:
There are N items and a backpack with a capacity of V. Each item can only be used once.
The volume of the i-th item is v[i], and the value is w[i].
Determine which items to put into the backpack so that the total volume of these items does not exceed the backpack's capacity, and the total value is maximized. Return the maximum value.

Example 1:
Input: N = 3, V = 4, v = [4, 3, 1], w = [1, 2, 1]
Output: 2

Constraints:
0 < N, V, v[i], w[i] â‰¤ 100
