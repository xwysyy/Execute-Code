# Problem Statement:
Given an array $a$ of $n$ elements, print any value that appears at least three times or print -1 if there is no such value.

The main function of the solution is defined as: 
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int solve(int &n, vector<int> &a) {   
        // write your code here
    }
};
```
Where:  
- return the minimum value that appears at least three times, or -1 if there is no such value.

# Example 1:
- Input:  
n = 5  
a = [1, 2, 3, 2, 2]
- Output:  
2

# Constraints:
- $0 \leq n \leq 100000$
- $1 \leq  a[i] \leq n$ 
- Time limit: 1000 ms  
- Memory limit: 64 KB
