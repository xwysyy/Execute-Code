# Problem Statement
Petya has an array $a_i$ of $n$ integers. His brother Vasya became envious and decided to make his own array of $n$ integers.

To do this, he found $m$ integers $b_i$ ($m\ge n$), and now he wants to choose some $n$ integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array $c_i$ of length $n$.

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total difference $D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i|$ to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference $D$ he can obtain.

The main function of the solution is defined as:  
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    long long solve(int &n, int &m, vector<int> &a, vector<int> &b) {   
        // write your code here
    }
};
```
where:  
- the return value is a 64-bit integer representing the maximum difference $D$

# Example 1:  
- Input:  
n = 4, m = 6
a = [6, 1, 2, 4]
b = [3, 5, 1, 7, 2, 3]
- Output:  
16

# Constraints:  
- $1 \leq n \leq m \leq 100000$
- $1 \leq a[i], b[i] \leq 10^9$ 
- Time limit: 1000 ms
