# Problem Statement
Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.

A level is a rectangular grid of $2$ rows and $n$ columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell $(1, 1)$ — at the intersection of the $1$\-st row and the $1$\-st column.

Monocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell $(x_1, y_1)$ to cell $(x_2, y_2)$ in one step if $|x_1 - x_2| \le 1$ and $|y_1 - y_2| \le 1$. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.

There are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.

To complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell $(2, n)$ — at the intersection of row $2$ and column $n$.

Help Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.

Solution Function**  
The solution's main function is:  
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string solve(int &n, string &s1, string &s2) {
        // write your code here
    }
};
```
where:  
- `n` is an integer representing the number of columns in the grid.
- `s1` is a string representing the first row of the grid.
- `s2` is a string representing the second row of the grid.
- The function should return a string: `"YES"` if it is possible to complete the level, or `"NO"` otherwise.

# Example 1  
- Input:  
n = 6
s1 = 010101
s2 = 101010
- Output:  
YES

**Constraints**
