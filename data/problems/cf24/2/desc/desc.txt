# Problem Statement
Sasha found an array $a$ consisting of $n$ integers and asked you to paint elements.

You have to paint each element of the array. You can use as many colors as you want, but each element should be painted into exactly one color, and for each color, there should be at least one element of that color.

The cost of one color is the value of $\max(S) - \min(S)$, where $S$ is the sequence of elements of that color. The cost of the whole coloring is the **sum** of costs over all colors.

For example, suppose you have an array $a = [\color{red}{1}, \color{red}{5}, \color{blue}{6}, \color{blue}{3}, \color{red}{4}]$, and you painted its elements into two colors as follows: elements on positions $1$, $2$ and $5$ have color $1$; elements on positions $3$ and $4$ have color $2$. Then:

-   the cost of the color $1$ is $\max([1, 5, 4]) - \min([1, 5, 4]) = 5 - 1 = 4$;
-   the cost of the color $2$ is $\max([6, 3]) - \min([6, 3]) = 6 - 3 = 3$;
-   the total cost of the coloring is $7$.

For the given array $a$, you have to calculate the **maximum** possible cost of the coloring.

The main function of the solution is defined as:  
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int solve(int &n, vector<int> &a) {   
        // write your code here
    }
};
``` 
where:  
- return: return the maximum possible cost of the coloring

# Example 1:  
- Input:  
n = 5
a = [1, 5, 6, 3, 4]
- Output:  
7

# Constraints:  
- $1 \leq n \leq 100000$
- $1 \leq a[i] \leq 10^3$  
- Time limit: 1000 ms  
- Memory limit: 64 KB
