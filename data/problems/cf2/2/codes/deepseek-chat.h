        // Since the rooms are in a circle, any room is part of a cycle if the conveyor belts allow it
        // So, we can count the number of rooms that are part of a cycle
        // Given the circular arrangement, all rooms are part of a cycle unless the conveyor belts are all in one direction
        // But since we already handled that case, we can assume that all rooms are returnable
        // However, this is not always true, so we need a better approach

        // Let's consider that a room is returnable if it can reach itself in a cycle
        // We can use a graph traversal to find cycles
        // But with n up to 100000, we need a linear time solution

        // Given the circular nature, we can consider that a room is returnable if it can reach itself by following the conveyor belts
        // So, we can simulate the movement of a snake starting from each room and see if it can return to the starting room
        // However, this would be O(n^2), which is too slow

        // Instead, we can observe that a room is returnable if the conveyor belts form a cycle that includes the room
        // Since the rooms are in a circle, the conveyor belts form a cycle if they are not all in the same direction
        // So, if there is at least one conveyor belt in a different direction, all rooms are returnable
        // Otherwise, if all conveyor belts are in the same direction, all rooms are returnable only if the direction allows it

        // So, the only case where not all rooms are returnable is when all conveyor belts are in the same direction and the direction does not allow a cycle
        // But in a circular arrangement, any single direction will allow a cycle
        // Therefore, all rooms are returnable unless all conveyor belts are in the same direction and the direction does not allow a cycle
        // But in a circle, any single direction will allow a cycle
        // So, all rooms are returnable
