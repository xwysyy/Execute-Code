# Problem Statement
You are given a binary array $a$ of $n$ elements, a binary array is an array consisting only of $0$s and $1$s.

A blank space is a segment of **consecutive** elements consisting of only $0$s.

Your task is to find the length of the longest blank space.

The main function of the solution is defined as:  
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int solve(int &n, vector<int> &a) {   
        // write your code here
    }
};
```
where:  
- return the length of the longest blank space.

# Example 1:  
- Input:  
n = 5
a = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
- Output:  
2

# Constraints:  
- $1 \leq n \leq 1000000$  
- $0 \leq a_i \leq 1$
- Time limit: 1000 ms  
- Memory limit: 6400 KB
