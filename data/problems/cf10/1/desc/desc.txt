# Problem Statement:
You find yourself on an unusual crossroad with a weird traffic light. That traffic light has three possible colors: red (r), yellow (y), green (g). It is known that the traffic light repeats its colors every $n$ seconds and at the $i$\-th second the color $s_i$ is on.

That way, the order of the colors is described by a string. For example, if $s=$"rggry", then the traffic light works as the following: red-green-green-red-yellow-red-green-green-red-yellow- ... and so on.

More formally, you are given a string $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n$ of length $n$. At the first second the color $s_1$ is on, at the second — $s_2$, ..., at the $n$\-th second the color $s_n$ is on, at the $n + 1$\-st second the color $s_1$ is on and so on.

You need to cross the road and that can only be done when the green color is on.

You know which color is on the traffic light at the moment, but you don't know the current moment of time. You need to find the minimum amount of time in which you are guaranteed to cross the road.

You can assume that you cross the road immediately.

For example, with $s=$"rggry" and the current color r there are two options: either the green color will be on after $1$ second, or after $3$. That way, the answer is equal to $3$ — that is the number of seconds that we are guaranteed to cross the road, if the current color is r.

The main function of the solution is defined as: 
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int solve(int &n, char &c, string &s) {   
        // write your code here
    }
};
```
Where:  
- `n` is an integer representing the length of the string \(s\).  
- `c` is a character representing the current color of the traffic light.  
- `s` is a string representing the sequence of colors in the traffic light.  
- The function should return an integer: the minimum guaranteed time in seconds after which you can cross the road.

# Example 1:
- Input:  
n = 5  
c = 'r'  
s = "rggry"
- Output:  
3

# Constraints:
- $1 \leq n \leq 100000$  
- $c, s_i \in \{r, g, y\}$
- Guaranteed solution exists
- Time limit: 1000 ms  
- Memory limit: 640 KB
