# Problem Statement
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have an array $a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n$. The game consists of two steps:

-   First, Alice will remove **at most** $k$ elements from the array.
-   Second, Bob will multiply **at most** $x$ elements of the array by $-1$.

Alice wants to maximize the sum of elements of the array while Bob wants to minimize it. Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both players play optimally.

The main function of the solution is defined as:  
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int solve(int &n, int &k, int &x, vector<int> &a) {   
        // write your code here
    }
};
```
where:  
- `n` is the number of elements in the array, `k` is the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, and `x` is the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by $-1$.
- `a` is the array of elements.
- The return value is the sum of elements of the array after the game.

# Example 1:  
- Input:  
n = 4, k = 1, x = 1
a = [3, 1, 2, 4]
- Output:  
2

# Constraints:  
- $1 \leq n \leq 100000$  
- $1 \leq x,k \leq n$
- $1 \leq a[i] \leq 10^3$ 
- Time limit: 1000 ms
