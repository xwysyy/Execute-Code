class SolutionTo solve the problem of processing queries on an array where we need to add values to even and odd elements separately, we can adopt a more efficient approach without repeatedly traversing the entire array for every query. Instead of directly modifying the array with each query, we can keep track of two separate additions: one for odd elements and one for even elements.

Here's a breakdown of how we can accomplish this:

1. **Initialization**: We start by computing the initial sum of the array.

2. **Track Additions**: Maintain two variables, `oddAdd` and `evenAdd`, to track the cumulative additions for odd and even indexed elements, respectively.

3. **Processing Queries**:
   - For a "0 x_j" query (which affects even elements): We increase `evenAdd` by `x_j`.
   - For a "1 x_j" query (which affects odd elements): We increase `oddAdd` by `x_j`.

4. **Calculate Final Sum**: After processing each query, calculate the adjusted sum of the array. This can be done based on the counts of odd and even elements:
   - Count the number of even and odd elements in the initial array.
   - The current sum can be calculated as:
     - `sum = initial_sum + count_even * evenAdd + count_odd * oddAdd`.

5. **Output**: Store the sums after each query to return as output.

This approach ensures that each query is handled in constant time, making the overall complexity depend primarily on the initialization phase and the number of queries.

Hereâ€™s how the code implementation looks:
