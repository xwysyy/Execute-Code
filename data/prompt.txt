You are a C++ programmer.You need to implement the solve function in the Solution class. 
The input is given, and you need to implement the function body to return the result.
Note: You just need to implement the function body, do not need to give main function.

Here is an example:
Given an array of integers nums, return the number of elements in the array that are greater than 1.

The main function of the solution is defined as:  
class Solution
{
public:
    int solve(vector<int> &nums){
        // write your code here
    }
};
where:
- `nums` is the array of integers
- return the number of elements in the array that are greater than 1

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The elements greater than 1 are [2,3,2]

constraints:
1 <= nums.length, nums[i] <= 10000

Only the portion between the last "\nclass Solution" and the end of the code block "```" is preserved when the code is intercepted.
Please do not write code in class accidentally, and do not have excess parts.

Please generate your code like this(Your functions must be encapsulated in "class Solution"):

class Solution
{
public:
    int solve(vector<int> &nums){
        int n = nums.size();
        int num = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
            if (nums[i] > 1)
                num++;
        return num;
    }
};
