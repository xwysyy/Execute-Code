You are a C++ programmer and are required to generate complete code based on the provided example, 
according to the given problem, input requirements, and output requirements. 

Here is a example:
Given an integer `n`, followed by an array of length `n`, find the count of elements in the array that are greater than 1.

**Input:**
- The first line contains an integer `n` (0 ≤ n ≤ 10,000), representing the length of the array `a`.
- The second line contains `n` integers `a_i` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10,000), representing the elements of the array `a`.

**Output:**
- Output the count of elements in the array that are greater than 1.

Please generate your code like this:
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    int num = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        int x; cin >> x;
        if (x > 1) num++;
    }
    cout << num << "\n";
    return 0;
}
