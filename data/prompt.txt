You are a C++ programmer.You need to implement the solve function in the Solution class. 
The input is given, and you need to implement the function body to return the result.
Note: You just need to implement the function body, do not need to give main function.

Here is an example:
Given an array of integers nums, return the number of elements in the array that are greater than 1.

The main function of the solution is defined as:  
`int solve(vector<int> &nums)`  
where:
- `nums` is the array of integers
- return the number of elements in the array that are greater than 1

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The elements greater than 1 are [2,3,2]

constraints:
1 <= nums.length, nums[i] <= 10000

Please generate your code like this:

class Solution
{
public:
    int solve(vector<int> &nums)
    {
        int n = nums.size();
        int num = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
            if (nums[i] > 1)
                num++;
        return num;
    }
};
